== Code Batch

To Do:

1. Uploading images w/ CarrierWave sometimes causes the heroku to timeout. Switch to Carrierwave Direct

2. Find a decent, full-text search add-on for Postgres that isn't Websolr and won't cost me $20 a month.

3. Create individual feeds based on following users $ tags.

4. Create functionality for private posts.
